# LetsCarpool

An android application where users share their ride by carpooling hence saving fuel and tiredness from driving in long traffic jams.


Its a platform which can store and learn from user activities so that user doesn't have to manually input his/her travel details and automatically gets notified about the commuters on his route.
Implemented a simple registration system from mobile phone and linked social networks profiles, or manual fill and develop a very simple UI.
Build it similar, simple and intuitive like Twitter. Use parameters like “where are you going?”. Car position is essential: drivers should get a message and just confirm or refuse a
ride.


Platform which tracks user's activities over a period of time and try to learn his travel schedule. In India people usually leave for office between 8:00-10:00 am and returns home between 5:00 – 7:00 pm. So at 8:00 am application knows that its time for the user to go to office and should be notified about other users who might be traveling on his route which can be his colleagues, or people working in nearby offices.

When a user or commuter is found on the same route,profile(facebook,linkedIn, twitter etc.) of the commuter is shown to the rider and vice-versa and both of them can chat with each other, it kills the awkwardness and both the commuters can trust each other better.

Furthermore, in-app wallet where commuter can easily and quickly pay the rider as asking money
can be a bit awkward in the first meeting.

By siging up with Facebook user can locate his/her friends and see their if travel schedule matches
with their own travel schedule then they accordingly pool with them. This add up the trust factor
and more users will be inclined to use the app.

Locate on Map feature makes it easy to locate exactly where the rider is. A commuter can easily see
the exact position of the rider and what route did he traveled while going to the office/home.
